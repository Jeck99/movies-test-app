        <p>Black Panther is a 2018 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name.
            Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 18th film in
            the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Ryan Coogler, who co-wrote the screenplay with
            Joe Robert Cole, and it stars Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther alongside Michael B. Jordan,
            Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett,
            Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis. In Black Panther, T'Challa is crowned king of Wakanda following his
            father's death, but he is challenged by Killmonger who plans to abandon the country's isolationist policies
            and begin a global revolution.
            Wesley Snipes expressed interest in working on a Black Panther film in 1992, but the project did not come to
            fruition. In September 2005, Marvel Studios announced a Black Panther film as one of ten based on Marvel
            characters and distributed by Paramount Pictures. Mark Bailey was hired to write a script in January 2011.
            Black Panther was officially announced in October 2014, and Boseman made his first appearance as the
            character in Captain America: Civil War (2016). Cole and Coogler had joined by then, with additional casting
            in May making Black Panther the first Marvel film with both a predominantly black cast and a black director.
            Principal photography took place from January to April 2017 at EUE/Screen Gems Studios in the Atlanta
            metropolitan area, and Busan, South Korea.
            Black Panther premiered in Los Angeles on January 29, 2018, and was released theatrically in the United
            States on February 16, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. Critics praised its direction, screenplay, acting
            (particularly that of Boseman, Jordan, and Wright), costume design, production values, and soundtrack,
            although the CG effects received some criticism. Many critics considered it to be one of the best films set
            in the MCU and noted its cultural significance, with organizations including the National Board of Review
            and American Film Institute naming it one of the top 10 films of 2018. The film grossed over $1.3 billion
            worldwide and broke numerous box office records, including the highest-grossing film by a black director. It
            became the ninth-highest-grossing film of all time, the third-highest-grossing film in the U.S. and Canada,
            and the second-highest-grossing film of 2018.
            The film received numerous awards and nominations, with seven nominations at the 91st Academy Awards
            including Best Picture, with wins for Best Costume Design, Best Original Score, and Best Production Design.
            Black Panther is the first superhero film to receive a Best Picture nomination and the first MCU film to win
            an Academy Award. It also received three nominations at the 76th Golden Globe Awards, two wins at the 25th
            Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three wins at the 24th Critics' Choice Awards from twelve nominations, among
            others. A sequel, with Coogler returning to write and direct, is scheduled for July 2022.</p>
